## Purpose

This project aims to:

-   Preserve and promote the Punjabi language
-   Showcase free, accessible learning resources

Thanks to everyone that build tools and websites to help people learn Punjabi, there are hundreds and thousands of websites out there. However, it can get quite overwhelming trying to find them. Which is why I made PunjabiGuide so you can find all the websites you need to master Punjabi all in one space.
